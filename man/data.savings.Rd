\description{
This data set describes the savings behavior of 50 countries in 1960-1970. The data set includes demographical variables as well as variables on disposable income.
}

\details{
Under the life-cycle savings hypothesis as developed by Franco Modigliani, the savings ratio (aggregate personal saving divided by disposable income) is explained by per-capita disposable income, the percentage rate of change in per-capita disposable income, and two demographic variables: the percentage of population less than 15 years old and the percentage of the population over 75 years old. The data are averaged over the decade 1960-1970 to remove the business cycle or other short-term fluctuations.

In Auer et al. (2023, Chaps. 9, 10 & 12) the data set is used to illustrate the econometric analysis of a multivariate linear regression model.
